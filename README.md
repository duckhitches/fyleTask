# WorkoutApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.1.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Coverage summary and report
Instead of 1 component, I have tested 3-components(user-form, workout-list, workout-chart) and 1-service(UserDataService) for my own satisfaction. Testing done with Karma by ng test --code-coverage.

## My assumptions
Is that (for github users) is that make sure the components imports are proper in app.module.ts, cause we might mistakenly add the standalone components in ngModel
